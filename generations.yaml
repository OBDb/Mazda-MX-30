    description: "The Mazda MX-30 marks Mazda's first mass-produced all-electric vehicle, featuring distinctive styling and an environmentally conscious approach to materials and design. The exterior showcases a unique interpretation of Mazda's Kodo design language with a coupe-like profile, pillarless 'freestyle' rear-hinged back doors reminiscent of the RX-8 sports car, and a floating roof design. Built on a modified version of Mazda's SkyActiv platform, it's powered by a relatively modest electric drivetrain with a 35.5 kWh battery and single electric motor producing 143 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, providing an EPA-estimated range of approximately 100 miles in the US market (124 miles WLTP in European markets). Mazda's 'right-sizing' philosophy deliberately uses a smaller battery to reduce environmental impact and weight while meeting the daily driving needs of urban customers. DC fast charging capability allows charging to 80% in approximately 36 minutes. The interior emphasizes sustainability with recycled materials including fabric made from plastic bottles, cork trim (honoring Mazda's origins as a cork manufacturer), and 'Heritage Cork' center console surfaces. Technology includes a 7-inch touchscreen dedicated to climate controls, an 8.8-inch center display for infotainment controlled by a rotary commander, and comprehensive safety features through i-Activsense. A 2022 addition to some markets is the MX-30 R-EV, a plug-in hybrid variant featuring a small rotary engine acting as a generator to extend range while maintaining the same electric drive motor. This rotary engine—Mazda's first production application since the RX-8—is compact and lightweight, designed specifically as a generator rather than directly driving the wheels. Available in limited markets and volumes, the first-generation MX-30 represents Mazda's unique approach to electrification, prioritizing a holistic view of environmental impact, distinctive design, and driving dynamics rather than maximum range or acceleration."
